        <h1><a href="/index.html" class="ink-link">Cade Ross</a> + Solana</h1>
        <p id="blurb">I collaborated with Solana to craft the brand identity for SolanaU, their university initiative. This endeavor involved designing a cohesive visual language that reflects Solana's iconic brand while appealing to an academic audience. The result, I believe, successfully bridges the gap between blockchain innovation and educational pursuit.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>I began with an extensive research phase, diving deep into Solana's existing brand guidelines, the blockchain education landscape, and current trends in edtech branding. I also conducted interviews with key stakeholders from Solana and potential SolanaU participants to understand their vision and expectations.</p>
                <p>Drawing from my research, I developed multiple concept directions that explored different ways to merge Solana's technological prowess with academic tradition. I experimented with various color palettes, typography styles, and iconography that could represent both blockchain concepts and educational themes.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Through several rounds of feedback and refinement, I honed in on a design direction that resonated with both Solana's team and our target audience. I focused on creating a flexible system that could adapt to various applications, from digital platforms to physical marketing materials.</p>
                <p>The identity below was the decided-upon direction. The brand shines with a minimal black and white palette, taking advantage of both the negative and positive space it bears. This is seen with the reversible U mark, allowing the custom letter to be used both filled and stroked depending on the situation and style needed.</p>

                <p>Overall, it was a true joy and honor to have this opportunity to partner with a company I greatly admire. I have loved working through this process to craft what is a symbol of personal growth and education in the blockchain community. I look forward to seeing how SolanaU continues to grow and educate others in the future.</p>

        <h1><a href="/index.html" class="ink-link">Cade Ross</a> + Zircon</h1>
        <p id="blurb">I partnered with Zircon, a startup in the Solana ecosystem, 
            to design their new learning platform. Their goal is to make learning 
            the skills needed to build on the Solana blockchain more accessible.</p>
        <div class="section">
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-1.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>This project included a complete rebrand, a new marketing website, 
                    and the ground-up design of their new learning platform. I was 
                    responsible for all of the design work, including the logo, branding, 
                    and UI/UX design of the platform. We began with the brand exploration 
                    below.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Brand</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>When thinking about the Zircon brand, I wanted to explore the 
                    essence of creating something new, of exploring and learning, 
                    of charting new paths. With these precepts in mind, I embarked 
                    on designing three unique identities to present to the founder.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-5.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>The first I nicknamed "Laboratory". The “Laboratory”
                    mark resembles both a Z and the swirling of a beaker. Through
                    Zircon, users enter its laboratory to grow in Solana and its
                    surrounding ecosystem. This brand brings the overall purpose
                    of Zircon into visual form..</p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-6.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>The second identity takes on a rounded look that is modern and joyful.
                    The “Progress!” mark is lean and invokes a feeling of progression,
                    movement, and advancement forward. This concept is integral
                    within the Zircon platform. The mark also takes the shape of a Z,
                    reaffirming the overall identifiability of the Zircon brand.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-7.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>Lastly, the “Wayfinder” mark resembles a compass that symbolizes
                    how Zircon leads its users through the Solana ecosystem and
                    guides them along their path. Zircon is the gateway and north
                    star for those who want to develop in the Solana ecosystem.
                    The “Wayfinder” mark and identity reflects this core truth.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Marketing Website</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Along with presenting the three brand options to Zircon's founder, I paired them with a landing page. Each are similar, but differ uniquely to adopt the respective brand identity.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-8.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>In the "Laboratory" page, I took the pink aesthetic and expanded upon it, crafting a full page around the identity. Along with the copy the founder requested, I added in a variety of elements that further emphasize the forward thinking, blockchain based company.
                    The three graphics floating at the
                    bottom half of the screen each
                    highlight a unique part of Zircon
                    and gives prospective users a
                    glimpse into what they offer.
                </p>
                <p>The first covers the instructional content that Zircon covers when learning Solana development. The second represents the imbedded code editor Zircon offers, and the third is the leaderboard of top learners. Each of these elements will be shown in greater detail in the learning platform section below. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-9.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>The “Progress!” landing page is
                    rounded in nature and takes on a
                    vibrant blue as the primary color.
                    It adopts the Libre Franklin
                    typeface this identity uses.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-10.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>Lastly, this version holds the "Wayfinder" brand with a deep purple.</p>
                <p>After presenting the three brand options and their accompaning marketing page, Zircon's founder selected the "Laboratory" pair. Now that the brand has been confirmed, I moved onwards towards crafting the learning platform.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Learning Platform</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>The Zircon learning platform has three core sections: Challenges, Learn, and Sandbox. I was tasked to design each with my own interpretation of the identity and company, as this is a recently funded startup with great room for exploration.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-2.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>First, the Challenges view. The founder had a clear idea of the type of content they wanted to display here. I took their ideas and wrapped them into the brand we just crafted, presenting the page above. An aspect of the Challenges view I particularly like is the Top Builders section. As people join Zircon and begin learning, they will begin to accumulate XP. The side panel on the right highlights the top ten. I think it adds a fun competitive edge to learning and could be expanded in a variety of ways in the future.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-3.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>Second is the Learn view, where all the educational content can be found. The content here is broken up by difficulty, with abstract shapes as placeholder items until the founder decides how they want to present the course content. Below the three course tenets are additional resources published by Solana that students can access.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="/images/zircon/zircon-4.png" class="study-img" alt="Solana Project">
            <div class="text">
                <p>Lastly, the Sandbox is a space for learners to explore the programming knowledge they have been pursuing and try different ideas directly in their browser through the integrated IDE. They can save their code as "Snippets" and come back to them later. I could see a future scenario where learners can publish their Snippets to the community and gain feedback not only on their code but contribute to others' too.</p>
                <p>A primary pillar for me, throughout this project, was cohesion among every aspect of the Zircon experience. I believe, as you use and interact with Zircon, whether through social media or their platform, it should feel like an extension of one another. Nothing abrupt. I believe we accomplished this here, and I look forward to seeing the many people who will benefit from Zircon's learning initiatives.</p>
